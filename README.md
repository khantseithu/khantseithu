**`a dev`**

👋 Hey there! I'm Khant Sithu, a 19 y/o passionate and driven Full Stack Developer. I'm deeply immersed in the world of web development and software engineering. My journey began with a love for problem-solving and a fascination with creating things that have a real impact.

🚀 My expertise spans the realms of both frontend and backend development. From crafting intuitive user interfaces with React and TypeScript to building robust server-side applications using Node.js, I thrive on crafting elegant solutions that marry form and function.

🌐 As an advocate for clean and maintainable code, I believe in continuous learning and growth. My curiosity led me to explore various technologies like Next.js, Express.js, Django / DRF and Laravel, as well as delve into the intricacies of asynchronous programming, API integration, and security protocols.

📚 When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest developments in the tech world, seeking inspiration from open-source projects, or collaborating with fellow developers to tackle exciting challenges. Whether it's a creative UI, a scalable API, or a comprehensive system architecture, I'm always excited to dive into the next coding adventure.
